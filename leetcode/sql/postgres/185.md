### Problem

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:

Input:

Employee table:

| id  | name  | salary | departmentId |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1   | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2   | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3   | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4   | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5   | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6   | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7   | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

Department table:

| id  | name  |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | IT    |
| 2   | Sales |

Output:

| Department | Employee | Salary |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

#### Explanation:

In the IT department:

- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:

- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

### Solution

```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
select d.name as "Department", e.name as "Employee", e.salary as "Salary"
from (
    select
        departmentId as deptId, salary,
        rank() over (partition by departmentId order by salary desc) as ranked
    from (
        select distinct departmentId, salary from employee
    )
) a
join employee e on e.departmentId = a.deptId and a.salary = e.salary
join department d on d.id = e.departmentId
where a.ranked <= 3
```
